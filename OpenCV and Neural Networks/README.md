# Project Title

OpenCV and Neural Networks.

## About The Project

The OpenCV package provides innovative ways to carry out a range of computer-vision-based activities. It may be used for object identification, facial recognition in real-time, object processing, and video capture, among other things.

This project demonstrates how to predict different labels in an image in openCV and neural networks using following steps: 
* It begins with grabbing a picture to work with. In this scenario, it grabsÂ an image of a stop sign and an Owl. 
* Then it creates the image data.
* After that it creates ML model for image feature detection.
* Then it trains the model using neural network to predict different labels in an image.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* You need python 3.6.10 in your system

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the jupyter notebook up and running.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ahujajitesh63/Library-OpenCV.git
$ cd Library-Machine-Learning
$ cd Detect Objects with Masking using openCV
$ pip install notebook
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python -m notebook
```
* Click and Run the Notebook - OpenCV- Create image data, Create ML model for image feature detection and train model using neural network to predict different labels in an image.ipynb
