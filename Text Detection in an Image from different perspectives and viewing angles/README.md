# Project Title

Text Detection in an Image from different perspectives and viewing angles.

## About The Project

The OpenCV package provides innovative ways to carry out a range of computer-vision-based activities. It may be used for object identification, facial recognition in real-time, object processing, and video capture, among other things.

This project uses the procedures listed below to show text detection in an image using openCV from various viewpoints and viewing angles:
* The process starts with selecting a picture to work with. 
* In this case, it gets a text-filled image from a different point of view and straightens it with openCV's wrap-perspective function. 
* Finally, text in a straightend picture is detected using the Pytesseract package.
