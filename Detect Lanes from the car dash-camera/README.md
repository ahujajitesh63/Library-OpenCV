# Project Title

Detect Lanes from the car dash-camera.

## About The Project

The OpenCV package provides innovative ways to carry out a range of computer-vision-based activities. It may be used for object identification, facial recognition in real-time, object processing, and video capture, among other things.
This project demonstrates how to recognise lanes in a vehicle's dash camera using following steps:
* It first loads the lanes-containing video or stream. 
* Then, using openCV, it analyses each video frame to find lanes. 
* The code then highlights the recognised lanes in each frame and saves the frames as a new movie.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* You need python 3.6.10 in your system

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the jupyter notebook up and running.

```
$ pip install notebook
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ git clone https://github.com/ahujajitesh63/Library-OpenCV.git
$ cd Library-Machine-Learning
$ cd Detect Lanes from the car dash-camera
$ python -m notebook
```
* Click and Run the Notebook - OpenCV - Detect Lanes from the car dash-camera.ipynb

### Result
* Input: Road as recorded from the dash camera:
