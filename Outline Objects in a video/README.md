# Project Title

Outline Objects in a video.

## About The Project

The OpenCV package provides innovative ways to carry out a range of computer-vision-based activities. It may be used for object identification, facial recognition in real-time, object processing, and video capture, among other things.

This project demonstrates how to Outline Objects in a video in openCV using following steps: 
* It begins with grabbing a video to work with. In this scenario, it grabs an video of a road. 
* Then it draws all the objects in a video using contour detection in openCV. 
* There may be lot of small contours drawn in the video that are not necessary.
* For this problem, the project demonstrates how altering the threshold of minimum contour size may aid in reducing the unnecesary contours or avoid detecting small objects in the video.
